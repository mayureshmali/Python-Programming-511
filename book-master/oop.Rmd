# Object-Oriented Programming {#oop}

<p class="alert">This chapter is under development. More details coming soonâ€¦</p>

So far, this book has discussed using a **procedural programming** style to write computer programs. Procedural programming focuses on defining functions (_procedures_) as sequences of instructions to execute. While you've used _control structures_ (e.g., conditionals and loops) to redirect the program flow, and _data structures_ (e.g., lists and dictionaries) to organize data, you have designed programs primarily based on which lines of code execute in what order.

**Object-oriented programming** is a programming paradigm (style) in which you don't design programs around the sequence of statements executed, but around the specification of **objects** which are combinations of _data_ (variables) and _behaviors_ (functions). Objects are used to represent elements in the program's real-world problem domain, and provide a useful _abstraction_ when designing programs: instead of needing to think about code statements executing in order, you can think about telling "things" to perform "actions".

- Using the [turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle) module is an example of object-oriented programming.

This chapter will discuss the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and how to specify **classes** (custom data types) that are used to define and create **objects**.


## Why Objects?
The whole point of using object-oriented programming is to perform **abstraction**: we want to be able to _encapsulate_ ("group") together parts of our code so we can talk about it at a higher level. So rather than needing to think about the program purely in terms of `integers`, `strings`, and `lists`, we can think about it in terms of `Dogs`, `Cats` or `Persons`.

As an example, consider how you might represent information about a _rectangle_ (e.g., in a drawing program). You could use individual variables to keep track of the rectangle's size an position:

```python
rect_x = 10
rect_y = 20
rect_width = 50
rect_height = 60
```

Of course, that's a lot of variables to remember (and chances to make typos in the names). So you might instead think about encapsulating that data into a tuple or dictionary:

```python
rect = (10, 20, 50, 60)  # as a tuple
rect = {x:10, y:20, width:50, height:60}  # as a dictionary (literal)
rect = dict(x=10, y=20, width=50, height=60)  # as a dictionary (using function)
```

This works well, until you want to have some way of associating _functionality_ with that data&mdash;that is, you want to be able to tell the `rect` variable to do something (e.g., "calculate your area!" "draw yourself!")


A **Class** (*class*ification) acts as
_template/recipe/blueprint_ for individual objects. It defines what data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) they have. An object is an "instance of" (example of) a class: we **instantiate** an object from a class. This lets you easily create multiple objects, each of which can track and modify its own data. 

In particular, classes _encapsulate_ two things:

1. The _data_ (variables) that describe the thing. These are known as **attributes**, **fields** or **instance variables** (variables that below to a particular _instance_, or example, of the class). For example, we might talk about a `Person` object's `name` (a String), `age` (a Number), and Halloween haul (an array of candy).

2. The _behaviors_ (functions) that operate on, utilize, or change that data. These are known as _methods_ (technically _instance methods_, since they operate on a particular instance of the class). For example, a `Person` may be able to `sayHello()`, `trickOrTreat()`, or `eatCandy()`.
