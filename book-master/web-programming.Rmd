# Web Programming

The most common use of programming in JavaScript is to create **dynamic, interactive web pages**: websites where the content changes over time or in response to user input _without the page reloading_. Almost any interaction that isn't following a hyperlink to a new web page is produce through JavaScript. This chapter provide an overview of using JavaScript to produce interactive web pages: using HTML syntax to define content, programmatically manipulating that content (using the D3 library), responding to user input, and dynamically downloading data.

## Web Pages and HTML
A webpage is simply a set of files that the browser _renders_ (shows) in a particular way, allowing you to interact with it. Webpage content (words, images, etc.) is formatted and structured using **HTML** (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage). This is code that functions similarly to [Markdown](#markdown) by allowing you to _annotate_ plain text (e.g., "this content is a heading", "this content is a hyperlink"), except it is much more flexible and powerful.

HTML annotates content by _surrounding_ it with **tags**:

![Element diagram](img/web-programming/element-diagram.png)

The **opening/start tag** comes before the content and tell the computer "I'm about to give you content with some meaning", while the **closing/end tag** comes after the content to tell the computer "I'm done giving content with that meaning." For example, the ```<h1>``` tag represents a [top-level heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) (equivalent to one `#` in Markdown), and so the open tag says "here's the start of the heading" and the closing tag says "that's the end of the heading". Taken together, the tags and the content they _contain_ are called an **HTML Element**. A website is made of a bunch of these elements.

Tags are written with a less-than symbol **```<```**, then the name of the tag (often a single letter), then a greater-than symbol **```>```**. An _end tag_ is written just like a _start tag_, but includes a forward slash `/` immediately after the less-than symbol&mdash;this indicates that the tag is closing the annotation. Line breaks and white space around tags (including indentation) is ignored.

- HTML tag names are not case sensitive, but you should always write them in all lowercase.
- Line breaks and white space around tags (including indentation) is ignored. Tags may thus be written on their own line, or inline with the content. 

The _start tag_ of an element may also contain one or more **attributes**. These are similar to attributes in object-oriented programming: they specify _properties_, options, or otherwise add additional meaning to an element. Like named keyword parameters in Python or HTTP query parameters, attributes are written in the format `attributeName=value` (no spaces are allowed around the `=`); values of attributes are almost always strings, and so are written in quotes. Multiple attributes are separated by spaces:

```html
<tag attributeA="value" attributeB="value">
   content
</tag>
```

For example, a hyperlink anchor (`<a>`) uses a `href` ("**h**ypertext **ref**erence") attribute to specify where the content should link to:

```html
<a href="https://ischool.uw.edu">iSchool homepage</a>
```

- In a hyperlink, the _content_ of the tag is the displayed text, and the _attribute_ specifies the link's URL. Contrast this to the same link in Markdown:

    ```markdown
    [iSchool homepage](https://ischool.uw.edu)
    ```

Every HTML element can include an **`id`** attribute, which is used to give them a unique identifier so that we can refer to them later (e.g., from JavaScript). `id` attributes are named like variable names, and must be **unique** on the page.

```html
<h1 id="title">My Web Page</h1>
```

Other common attributes include `style` for specifying appearance style rules, or `class` for giving a (space-separated) list of [Cascading Style Sheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS) classifications.

Some HTML elements don't require a closing tag because they _can't_ contain any content. These tags are often used for inserting media into a web page, such as with the `<img>` tag. With an `<img>` tag, you can specify the path to the image file in the `src` attribute, but the image element itself can't contain additional text or other content. Since it can't contain any content, we leave off the end tag entirely. However, we can optionally include the "end" slash **`/`** just before the greater-than symbol to indicate that the element is complete and to expect no further content:

```html
<!-- images have no text content! -->
<img src="picture.png" alt="description of image for screen readers and indexers" />
```

### Elements are Nested
HTML elements can be **nested**: that is, the content of an HTML element can contain _other_ HTML tags (and thus other HTML elements):

![An example of element nesting: the `<em>` element is nested in the `<h1>` element's content.](img/web-programming/nesting.png)

The semantic meaning indicated by an elements applies to _all_ its content: thus all the text in the above example is a top-level heading, and the content "(with emphasis)" is emphasized as well.

Because elements can contain elements which can _themselves_ contain elements, an HTML document ends up being structured as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">**"tree"**</a> of elements:

![An example DOM tree (a tree of HTML elements).](img/web-programming/dom-tree.jpg)

In an HTML document, the `<html>` element is the "root" element of the tree. Inside this we put a `<head>` element to represent "header" information (meta-data that is **not**shown on the page itself), and a `<body>` element to contain the document's "body" (the shown content):

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The title that appears in the browser tab</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>This is <em>conteeeeent</em>!</p>
  <body>
</html>
```

This model of HTML as a tree of "nodes"&mdash;along with an API (programming interface) for manipulating them&mdash; is known as the [**Document Object Model (DOM)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).

### Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
[**Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) is a syntax for representing ("coding") simple graphical images. For example, you can use SVG to define "a 100x200 pixel green rectangle at the top of the screen", or a squiggly line that follows a path a la Turtle Graphics! SVG images can be very complex and made up of lots of different shapes: most logos, icons, and other "non-photograph" images on the internet are defined using SVG.

SVG is used to represent [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)&mdash;that is, pictures defined in terms of the connection between points (lines and other shapes), rather than in terms of the pixels being displayed. In order to be shown on a screen, these lines are converted (_rastered_) into grids of pixels based on the size and resolution of the display. This allows SVG images to "scale" or "zoom" independent of the size of the display or the image&mdash;you never need to worry about things getting blurry as you make them larger!

SVG images are written in a [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage) syntax that is identical to that used by HTML (just with different "tags"). And in HTML5 (supported by all modern browsers), SVG elements can be included _directly_ in the HTML, allowing you to include&mdash;and more importantly, manipulate&mdash;these elements as if they were any other HTML element.

An SVG image is specified with an **`<svg>`** tag, inside of which is _nested_ the individual shapes and components that should be shown. `<svg>` tags are usually given `width` and `height` attributes specifying their size (in screen pixels). Inside the `<svg>` tag are nested further elements, each representing a different shape:

```html
<svg width=400 height=400> <!-- the image -->
   <!-- a rectangle -->
   <rect x=20 y=130 width=50 height=80 />

   <!-- a circle -->
   <circle cx=150 cy=150 r=35 />

   <!-- some text -->
   <text x=100 y=100>SVG!</text>

   <!-- a turtle-style "path" of a triangle -->
   <path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" />
</svg>
```

Notice that each "shape" uses different attributes to define its appearance:

- A `<rect>` has an (x,y) position, as well as a width and height.
- A `<circle>` has a "**c**enter-x" and "**c**enter-y" position, as well as a **r**adius.
- A `<text>` includes the text to show as the element's content.
- A `<path>` defines a turtle-style path as a string of instructions. For example, `M` means "**m**ove to" the following (absolute) coordinates, `L` means "draw a **l**ine to" the following (absolute) coordinates, and the `Z` means to "close/end" the path by drawing a line back to the start. See [the SVG specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) for complete details.

    Note that SVG paths can be quite complex. The below path represents the UW logo!

    ```html
    <path d="M 111.003,0 L 111.003,18.344 L 123.896,18.344 L 109.501,71.915 C 109.501,71.915 91.887,0.998 91.636,0 L 73.006,0 C 72.743,0.975 53.684,71.919 53.684,71.919 L 40.427,18.344 L 53.851,18.344 L 53.851,0 L 0,0 L 0,18.344 L 11.932,18.344 C 11.932,18.344 32.523,100.706 32.772,101.706 L 61.678,101.706 C 61.934,100.729 75.476,49.251 75.476,49.251 C 75.476,49.251 88.343,100.716 88.591,101.706 L 117.495,101.706 C 117.755,100.723 139.422,18.344 139.422,18.344 L 151.256,18.344 L 151.256,0 L 111.003,0 z"/> <!-- from wikicommons -->
    ```

Additionally, all SVG shape elements support attributes that indicate the _appearance_ of that shape. These include (among other options):

- **`fill`** indicates the color that the shape should be "filled in". This can be a [named colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) or [RGB hex codes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/the-code-side-of-color/).
- **`stroke`** indicates the color of the shape's _outline_. This can be different than the `fill` color.
- **`stroke-width`** can be used to specify the width of the shape's outline (in pixels).
- **`style`** allows you to specify CSS style properties (in a format `property:value;`), and is can be used for some appearance aspects that are not supported by specific attributes. For example, this can be used to make a shape transparent using the `opacity` property:

    ```html
    <!-- a circle that is 50% transparent -->
    <circle cx=100 cy=100 r=50 fill="red" style="opacity:0.5;" />
    ```

## DOM Manipulation with D3
You can use JavaScript to make a web page's content **dynamic** (change over time) and **interactive** (responding to user input) by writing a script that will _modify_ the HTML elements that are shown on the page: whether by changing their content, attributes, or even creating new elements!

Web browsers render HTML into a **DOM** tree that provides an [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) for performing these operations (e.g., by calling methods on the provided `document` global module). While this is a perfectly reasonable and effective way of making interactive web pages, this chapter will focus on how to use the [D3](https://d3js.org/) library to interact with the DOM. The D3 library provides more powerful and (slightly) easier-to-use functions for manipulating the HTML. Moreover, learning these functions now will make it easier to later use D3 for its primary purpose: creating interactive visualizations (described in the next chapter).

D3 is a third-party library, so as with Python modules you will need to "download" it and "import" it into your script. You do this by including a `<script>` tag with a _link_ to the online version of the library **before** the `<script>` tag for your script:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```

Note that this means you will need to be connected to the internet to utilize this library. If you need to write your program offline, you can instead download the library (the `d3.zip`) and load the included `d3.min.js` script by specifying a relative path to it.

<p class="alert alert-warning">D3 has gone through a number of versions over the years. This book assumes Version 5 (v5), which as released in March 2018. v5 is [mostly similar](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) to v4, but v4 and v3 have some significant differences in their APIs (which are more relevant in the next chapter). Be careful about referencing older examples and tutorials that may not use an up-to-date version of the library.</p>

### Selecting Elements
In order to modify the web page's HTML elements from a JavaScript script, the first thing you will need to do is get a **reference** to the particular element you wish to modify: that is, create a _variable_ whose value is an object corresponding to that element.

In D3, you can get this object by using the **`d3.select()`** function. This function takes as an argument a **string** specifying _which_ element in the DOM should be selected. This string can take a few different formats:

- Specifying the element's **tag name** will select the _first_ element on the page (from the top) with that tag:

    ```js
    var header = d3.select('h1'); //select the FRIST <h1> element
    ```

    Note that the angle brackets `<>` are _not_ included in the selector string&mdash;just the tag name itself.

    This format works great if you know there is only one element of a type on the page (e.g., if there is only one `<svg>` image on the page).

- You can select a particular element by its **`id`** attribute by using that `id` with a **`#`** immediately front of it:

    ```js
    var element = d3.select('#myElem'); //select element with attribute `id="myElem"`
    ```

    The `#` symbol can be read as "thing with id of". This format works great to select a particular element from many (as long as that element has an `id` attribute of course!)

- You can also use most any other standard [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) to be more precise about which element you wish to reference. In any case, the `d3.select()` function will return the **first** matching element.

The `d3.select()` function returns an object that is an instance of a **`d3.selection`** class. You can think of these as being "D3-specific" versions of that HTML DOM element. This object will provide a variety of methods that you can use to manipulate that element on the web page, as described below.

It is possible to select more than one element by using the `d3.selectAll()` function. This function also takes a selector string as an argument, but instead returns a `d3.selection` object that refers to **all** elements that "match" the selector. For example, `d3.selectAll('p')` will return an object representing all of the `<p>` (paragraph) elements on the page. This will allow you to easily manipulate large numbers of similar elements (e.g., all of the `<circle>` elements in a scatter plot).

- All the `d3.selection` object methods are **vectorized** (like with a `pandas` Series), meaning that they will apply to _each_ selected DOM element. Thus calling a method to change the result of a `d3.selectAll()` function will change _all_ of those elements in the same way. See below for examples.

It is also possible to call the `select()` and `selectAll()` methods on a `d3.selection` object. In this case, D3 will return the matching **child** element(s) from the DOM tree. For example, consider the HTML:

```html
<div id="firstGroup">
  <p>First paragraph</p>
</div>
<div id="secondGroup">
  <p>Second paragraph</p>
  <p>Third paragraph</p>
</div>
```

In order to get a reference to the "Second paragraph", you could use the following:

```js
var secondGroup = d3.select('#secondGroup');  //select second <div> by `id`
var paragraph = secondGroup.select(`p`);  //select first <p> inside that element
```

This allows you to interact with only particular "branches" of the DOM tree by first selecting the "root" of that branch, and then selecting the element(s) from that branch that you care about.

### Changing Elements
Once you have a _reference_ to an element, you can call methods on that object in order to modify its state in the DOM&mdash;which will in turn modify how it _currently_ is displayed on the page. Thus by calling these methods, you are dynamically changing the web page's content!

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Important**: these methods _do not change the `.html` source code file!_ Instead, they just change the _rendered DOM elements_ (think: the content stored in the computer's memory rather than in a file). If you refresh the page, the content will go back to how the `.html` source code file specifies it should appear&mdash;with any loaded `.js` scripts being applied. With such dynamic content, what is shown on the page is the HTML with the JavaScript modifications added in, which may be a far cry from the `.html` content itself!
</div>

#### Changing Content
You can change a selected element's **content** (e.g., the stuff between the start and close tags) by using the **`.text()`** method. This method takes as an argument the new content for the element (which will replace any old content):

```js
var paragraph = d3.select('p');
paragraph.text('This is new content!');  //change the paragraph's content.
```

Remember that an element's contents can include _other HTML elements_. However, any HTML included in the argument string will be _escaped_ and shown as text content (e.g., showing the `<>`). For example:

```js
var paragraph = d3.select('p');
paragraph.text('This is <em>new</em> content!');
```

will change the paragraph to display: "This is &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; content!"

If you want to include HTML elements inside the new content, you should instead use the `.html()` method:

```js
var paragraph = d3.select('p');
paragraph.html('This is <em>new</em> content!');
```

will change the paragraph to display: "This is _new_ content!"

- Be careful using `.html()` to display any user-provided data, since the content they give could include malicious `<script>` tags!
- The `.html()` method is primarily used for "inline" formatting tags like `<em>` (emphasis, italics) or `<strong>` (bold).
- The `.html()` method does not work with SVG elements; see below for other options.

Both the `.text()` and `.html()` methods can also be called without _any_ arguments. In this situation, the methods _return_ a string of the element's content without changing anything (`.text()` returns a string with all of the HTML tags removed). This lets you "get" the current contents of an element, such if if you want to do any string processing on it.

Calling either method on a selection with multiple elements (e.g., from `d3.selectAll()`) will cause the change to be made to _all_ of the elements in the selection.

#### Changing Attributes
You can change a selected element's **attributes** by calling the **`.attr()`** method on that selection. This method takes two arguments: the name of the attribute to change, and the new value to give to that attribute:

```js
var circle = d3.select('circle');  //select a circle
circle.attr('fill', 'green');  //make the circle green
```

The `.attr()` method _returns_ a reference to the object that it modified. You can then use that returned value as the _anonymous subject_ of additional method calls. This is called **chaining methods**:

```js
var circle = d3.select('circle')  //no semicolon!
    .attr('fill', 'green')        //call `.attr()` on (anonymous) result
    .attr('stroke', 'yellow')     //call `.attr() on (anonymous) result
    .attr('stroke-width', 5);     //semi-colon when all done
```

The first `d3.select()` call returns a selection for a `<circle>` element, which we then call `.attr()` on to change its fill color. That method returns _the same_ circle element, which we then call `.attr()` to change its stroke color. _That_ method then returns the same circle element again, which call `.attr()` on a third time to change its stroke width. The third `.attr()` returns the same circle yet again, which is the ultimate result of this expression and so is assigned to the `circle` variable.

- Method chaining is very common when working with D3 and in JavaScript in general, such as when you want to do lots of things in sequence to the same set of objects.

The `.attr()` method can also be called without the second argument (the new value), in which case it returns the _current_ value of the specified attribute.

Calling this method on a selection with multiple elements (e.g., from `d3.selectAll()`) will cause the change to be made to _all_ of the elements in the selection.

In addition to changing the attributes, you can also change components of the CSS `style` attribute directly using the `.style()` method. This takes similar arguments, and can be used for easily adjusting the style.

### Adding Elements
You can use JavaScript to add new elements as _children_ of a selection (e.g., inside that element) by using the **`append()`** method. This method takes as an argument the _name of the tag_ to create and add (without the `<>`). The `.append()` method _returns_ a reference to the newly created element, allowing you to call further methods (e.g., `.text()`, `.attr()`) to specify the content or attributes of this new element.

For example, if you have HTML:

```html
<div id="content">
</div>
```

then you could add a new `<p>` _inside_ that `<div>`, along with some content:

```js
var div = d3.select('#content');  //get reference to the <div>
var newP = div.append('p');  //add a new <p>
newP.text('Hello world!');  //set the content
```

which will produce:

```html
<div id="content">
   <p>Hello world!</p>
</div>
```

You can of course use _method chaining_ here as well, including to add and create multiple new elements at once!

Note that `append()` adds an element as the "last" child of the parent. If you wish to insert an element _before_ a sibling, using the `insert()` method with a second argument of a selector string for which element you want to the new one to precede. You can also remove a selected element by calling the `remove()` method on it.

Calling any of these methods on a selection with multiple elements (e.g., from `d3.selectAll()`) will cause the change to be made to _all_ of the elements in the selection&mdash;each element will have a new child added, or each element will be removed.


## User Events
In order to make your page **interactive** (that is, able to change in response to user actions), you need to be able to respond to _user events_. Whenever a user interacts with a computer, the operating system announces that interaction as an **event**&mdash;the _event_ of a button being clicked, the _event_ of the mouse being moved, the _event_ of a keyboard key being pressed, etc. These events are **broadcast** to the entire system, allowing any application (including the browser) to "respond" the occurrence of the event, such as by executing a particular JavaScript function.

Thus in order to respond to user actions (and the _events_ those actions generate), you need to define a function that will be executed **when the event occurs**. You will define a function as normal, but the function will not get called by you as a particular step or statement in your script. Instead, the function you specify will be executed _by the system_ when an event occurs, which will be at some indeterminate time in the future. This process is known as [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming). It is also an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">**asynchronous programming**</a>: in which statements are not executed in a single order one after another ("synchronously"), but may occur "out of order" or even at the same time!

In order for your script to respond to user events, you need to _register an event listener_. This is a bit like following someone on social media: you specify that you want to "listen" for updates from that person, and what you want to do when you "hear" some news from that person.

You can register event listeners using D3 by calling the **`on()`** method on an selected element (indicating that you want to do something _on_ hearing an event). This method takes two arguments: a string representing what kind of event you want to listen for, and a _callback function_ to execute when you hear that event:

```js
//a (named) callback function
function onClickCallback() {
    console.log("You clicked me!");
}

var button = d3.select('button'); //reference the element you want to "listen" to
button.on('click', onClickCallback);  //register a listener for 'click' events
```

When the button is clicked by the user, it will "shout" out a `'click'` event ("I was clicked! I was clicked!"). Because you have set up a "listener" (an alert/notification) for such an occurrence, your script will be able to do something&mdash;and that something that it will do is run the specified callback function.

- It’s like you handed someone a recipe and told them “when I call you, follow this recipe to bake a cake!”

- Note that this listener _only_ applies to that button&mdash;if you wanted to respond to a different button, you'd need to register a separate listener!

There are numerous different events you can listen for, including `'dblclick'` (double-click), `'keydown'` (keyboard key is pressed), `'hover'` (mouse "hovers" over the element), etc. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events> for a complete list of browser-supported events.

Note that it is _much_ more common to use an _anonymous function_ as the event callback:

```js
var button = d3.select('button');
button.on('click', function() {
    //do something here
    console.log("You clicked me!");
});
```

If you want to know more details about the event (e.g., _where_ the user clicked with the mouse, _which_ button was clicked), you can access the [`d3.event`](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#event) variable from inside the callback, which is an object with properties about the _current_ event.

Note that these event callback functions can occur repeatedly, over and over again (e.g., every time the user clicks the button). This makes them potentially act a bit like the body of a `while` loop. However, because these callbacks are _functions_ any variables defined within them are **scoped** to that function, and will not be available on subsequent executions. Thus if you want to keep track of some additional information (e.g., how many times the button was clicked), you will need to use a **global** variable declared outside of the function. Such variables can be used to represent the **state** (situation) of the program, which can then be used to determine what behavior to perform when an event occurs, following the below pattern:

```
WHEN an event occurs {
   check the STATE of the program;
   DECIDE what to do based on that state;
   UPDATE the state as necessary for the next event;
}
```

For example:

```js
var clickCount = 0;  //keep track of the "state"
d3.select('button').on('click', function() {
    if(clickCount > 10) {  //decide what to do
        console.log("I think you've had enough");
    }
    else {
        clickCount++;  //change state (+1)
        console.log('You clicked me!');
    }
});
```

"State" variables are often objects, with individual values stored as the properties. This provides a name-spacing feature, and helps to keep the code from being cluttered with too many variables.

## AJAX
While normally HTTP requests for data are sent through the browser (by entering a URL in the address bar), it is also possible to use D3 to programmatically send HTTP requests, similar to what you did in Python.

Having JavaScript code send an HTTP request is known as sending an [**AJAX**](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-ajax-for-front-end-designers--cms-25099) request. _AJAX_ is an acronym for **A**sychronous **J**avaScript **A**and **X**ML, and refers collectively to the techniques used to send these requests.

<div class="alert alert-info">
_Fun fact:_ AJAX was developed by Microsoft in the late 1990s, and originally was used to send requests for XML data. However, in modern web programming most AJAX requests sent to web services are used to download JSON data instead. Nevertheless, the AJAX name has stuck (instead of being renamed "AJAJ").
</div>

The other important part of using AJAX requests is that they are **asynchronous**. Downloading data from the internet can take a while (depending on the speed of the web server, the strength of the internet connection, etc). Rather than having the program "pause" and wait for this download to finish (as with _synchronous_ programming, like you did in Python), AJAX requests will 
occur _at the same time_ that the rest of the code is being executed. Thus the download and the remaining script will not be synchronized; they will be “asynchronous”.

- By default, you call a function to send the AJAX request, but then your script _keeps going_&mdash;executing the next line of code while the request is processed by the server and the data downloads "in the background".

    However, recent browsers (anything current that is _not_ Internet Explorer) support code that will let you treat asynchronous functions almost synchronously&mdash;telling the script to "wait" until the data downloads. That technique is covered below:


In order to send AJAX requests (for JSON data) using D3, you can use the `d3.json()` function. This function takes as a parameter the URI to query:

```js
var uri = 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=d3&sort=stars';

//send query to uri, specify callback function
d3.json(uri);

console.log('request sent');  //this statement will execute before data is received!
```

Because the `d3.json()` function is _asynchronous_, the script will keep running (executing the next line) while the data downloads. Indeed, the `d3.json()` function doesn't even return the data download, but instead returns what is called a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise), which is a value that acts like a "placeholder" for data to eventually arrive (think: an I.O.U.).

The easiest way to "wait" for the Promise to be fulfilled (i.e., for the data to be downloaded) before proceeding is to include the keyword **`await`** _before_ the function call. However, this keyword can only be used if the asynchronous function is called from inside another function that is also marked as being asynchronous&mdash;designated by putting the **`async`** keyword before the function declaration:

```js
// define async "wrapper" function
async function downloadData(){
    var uri = 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=d3&sort=stars';
    data = await d3.json(uri);  //wait for the asynchronous download to finish
                                //will now return the data downloaded instead of the Promise
    console.log(data);
}

downloadData(); //call the downloading function
```

Specifying that you want to `await` for a function to finish will cause cause that function to return the resulting data rather than the Promise placeholder&mdash;thus you can fetch the data from a URI and save it to a variable to work with later. As long as you wrap your downloading in what is called `async/await`, you will be able to download data somewhat "synchronously" like you do using the Python `requests` library.


<p class="alert alert-warning">In some browsers, you will not be able to send an AJAX request when the web page is loading via the `file://` protocol (e.g., by double-clicking on the `.html` file). This is a security feature to keep you from accidentally running an HTML file that contains malicious JavaScript that will download a virus onto your computer. Instead, you should run a local web server for testing AJAX requests, as described in the previous chapter.
</p>

Note that D3 also provides methods for sending AJAX requests that handle different data formats automatically. For example, `d3.csv()` will fetch an array of objects where each object's "keys" are based on the first (header) row in the CSV file. See the [d3.requests](https://github.com/d3/d3-request) module for details.
